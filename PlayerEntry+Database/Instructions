INSTRUCTIONS

Get all of the files in this folder
Ensure you ran the run.bash in the main to get all of the libraries.

To compile: "  g++ -Wall *.cpp -o PlayerEntry.exe -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lcurl  "     (replace *.cpp if you want with the program filenames)
Run using "   ./PlayerEntry.exe   "

Player Entry screen should appear.

To enter data: 
  Hover your mouse point over the "cell" you wish to enter data     (Traditional keyboard controls do not work at present)
  Left column is for IDs, right column for codenames
  ID + Codename = Player
  Typing with the mouse point over the cell will put text in the cell
  Entering IDs that are already in the database will cause the codename associated to appear in the second column. (The ID/Codename combos already in the database should print to console on program start)
  Press F12 to clear all of the cells
  Press F5 to finish entering data       (Exiting the window normally will end the program prematurely)
  You will be prompted in the console to enter the equipment ID for each Player with information for each team.
  Once equipment IDs are entered, a very early prototype concept for the Play Action screen will appear displaying the information you entered.
