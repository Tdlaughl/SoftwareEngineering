Get all of the files in this folder, and insure they are all in the same folder together.
Ensure you ran the run.bash/run.sh in the main to get all of the libraries.

To compile: "  g++ -Wall *.cpp -o PlayerEntry.exe -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lcurl  "     (replace *.cpp if you want with the program filenames)
Run using "   ./PlayerEntry.exe   "

Player Entry screen should appear.

To enter data: 
  Hover your mouse point over the "cell" you wish to enter data     (Traditional keyboard controls do not work at present)
  Left column is for IDs, middle column for codenames, right column for Equipment number.
  ID + Codename = Player
  Typing with the mouse point over the cell will put text in the cell
  Entering IDs that are already in the database will cause the codename associated to appear in the second column. (The ID/Codename combos already in the database should print to console on program start)
  Press F12 to clear all of the cells
  Press F5 to finish entering data       (Exiting the window normally will end the program prematurely)
  You will be prompted in the console to enter the equipment ID for each Player with information for each team.
  Once equipment IDs are entered, the Play Action screen will appear displaying the information you entered.
  Press the left arrow key to generate events in the scrolling text box.

  *If you want to see the equipment numbers, there is a commented out print statement next to the normal print statement in the PlayAction code that will show that info.
