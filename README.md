# What script to run to get all of the downloads
To get the code to work you will run the script called "run.sh" to download all of the files you would need for the project. (curl, SFML, g++, etc.) To do that you need to run "chmod +x run.sh" first then run "./run.sh"
To compile the program first get into the TeamFourFinalProject directory. Then run g++ -Wall *.cpp -o laser.exe -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lcurl. Then run ./laser.exe. While the countdown timer is counting down input into the terminal the hardware id numbers you put into the player entry screen.
